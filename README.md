# Heart-Disease_Prediction
Heart disease prediction model using different classification models and their comparisons. This project was made for the research paper "SVM Based Risk Estimation for Heart Disease Prediction" published under IEEE Xplore (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463271) and presented in amity universities' confluence-2024.

The data set used is from the UCI ML repository, the set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, Long Beach). It consists of 76 attributes but usually published experiments refer to a subset of 14 of them. 
1. Age 
2. Sex 
3. Chest pain type (cp) 
4. Blood pressure at rest (trestbps) 
5. Serum cholesterol (chol) in mg/dl 
6. Fasting blood sugar more than 120 mg/dl 
7. Resting electrocardiogram (restecg) findings 
8. The highest heart rate ever recorded (thalach) 
9. Exang (exercise-induced angina) 
10. Oldpeak ST depression caused by activity compared to rest 
11. The slope of the ST section of the peak workout 
12. Fluoroscopically colored main vessel count (0–3) 13. Thal: 0 denotes a normal condition, 1 a fixed abnormality, and 2 a reversible defect. 
14. Heart disease is present (target variable) - No presence (0), presence (1-4), or both.


Following are the test score results for all the models :
